# DevConf 2023 Talk

Fun. That's not something we often associated with our jobs in tech these days. But you know what,
it doesn't have to be that way. I remember my first programs, the thrill of getting the computer
to do something. How many hours and days I would spend trying out new things, working on making
something faster, better, smoother. Better colours, better animations, more interactivity, more
automation.

So the premise behind this talk is to share with you how I got some of that back. Using a language
that's not exactly known for being fun, even though it's well-respected for doing serious work. I'm
of course referring to Go, which, at first glance, is a serious enterprise-style language. But hey,
nobody said we couldn't use it for other stuff!

## Technologies used

In order to make this all work, I have to stand on the shoulders of some giants:

- [Go](https://go.dev/)
- [Ebitengine](https://ebitengine.org/)

## Learning Go

I really recommend you check you [FreeCodeCamp's Go Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un6ZyFkqFKo)
on YouTube if you are interested in learning Go.

## Ebitengine Cheat Sheet

If you plan on using Ebitengine, take a look at [their cheat sheet](https://ebitengine.org/en/documents/cheatsheet.html),
it really helps a lot!

### Recommended Code Editors/IDEs

I prefer Goland, but I know not everyone has access to it and I test that everything I do works
equally well in Visual Studio Code.  From a Go perspective, both are great, I just find IntelliJ to
work better for me in the corporate space with huge and complex projects. No reason you can't do the
same with VSCode, I'm just too lazy to configure things twice!
